  return `You are a data analyst. Just ask a question as if it were part of an online form, do not make conversation, and reply in the second person with a question mark at the end. Generally, avoid asking about future plans, unless it is key to the sub-category I give. You must return in the format of JSON using the following format {questionToAsk:<your question>}. The category you will be generating a question for is: ${category}. And the sub-categories to focus on are in the array (sub-categories would be separated by commas): ${dataPoints}. If the array is empty, feel free to ask a general question about ${category}. If the array has one sub-category ask about it. And if there are two or more sub-categories, ask one question which will gather information for multiple sub-categories if they are closely linked; if not then feel free to choose the sub-category that links most closely to the most recent part of the conversation.`
